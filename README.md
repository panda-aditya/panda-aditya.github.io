# Aditya Panda — Personal Developer Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and interests as a Computer Science undergraduate.

🌐 **Live site:** https://panda-aditya.github.io

## About the website

This is a simple, minimal, and responsive portfolio website designed to:
- Present my featured projects and technical work
- Share a short introduction about me and my interests
- Provide easy access to my GitHub, resume, and contact details

The site is intentionally kept lightweight and fast, with a focus on clarity and usability rather than heavy frameworks.

- **CSS3** — layout, styling, responsiveness

<p>I have been thinking for a long time about how to put this into words, because some feelings feel too big to fit neatly onto a page. Still, I want to try. After two and a half years with you, I know one thing with absolute certainty. You are the person I choose, again and again, in both the loud moments and the quiet ones. So today, with a full heart and a hopeful smile, I want to ask you something simple and sincere. Will you be my Valentine?</p>

<p>When I look back at our journey together, it is not just the big memories that stand out, but the countless small ones that quietly built something beautiful. The late conversations that drifted from serious to silly, the shared laughter over nothing in particular, the comfort of knowing I can be myself around you without fear or pretence. You have given me a sense of ease and belonging that I never knew I needed until I found it with you.</p>

<p>You have this incredible way of making the ordinary feel special. Even on days that feel heavy or exhausting, your presence lightens things. The way you listen, the way you understand without needing everything explained, the way you notice details that others miss. Being with you has taught me patience, softness, and how powerful quiet support can be. You have helped me grow in ways I may not always say out loud, but I feel them deeply.</p>

<p>I admire you more than you know. Your kindness, your thoughtfulness, your strength, and the care you bring into the lives of people you love inspire me every day. You have a warmth that feels like home, and a spark that keeps life exciting. With you, I feel safe enough to be vulnerable and brave enough to dream bigger. That balance is rare, and I treasure it.</p>

<p>Two and a half years with you have shown me that love is not just about grand gestures, but about consistency. It is choosing each other even when things are imperfect. It is laughter after misunderstandings and comfort during uncertainty. It is growing side by side while still being ourselves. I want to keep choosing you, not just today, but in all the little tomorrows that make up a life.</p>

<p>Valentine’s Day may seem like just another date on the calendar, but to me it feels like an opportunity to pause and celebrate you. To say clearly what I feel every single day. You matter to me. You make my world brighter. You make my future feel exciting and grounded at the same time.</p>

<p>So here I am, asking with honesty and affection. I would love for you to be my Valentine. Not just for the roses or the chocolates, but for the shared smiles, the inside jokes, the long talks, and the steady love that has grown between us. I want to keep making memories with you, both big and small, and to keep building something meaningful together.</p>

<p>Whatever your answer is, know that I am grateful for you and for everything we have shared. But I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that the answer is yes.</p>

<p class="closing">With all my love,<br>Adi</p>
